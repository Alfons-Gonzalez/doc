no lo he probado...so...la receta siguiente es una posibilidad:

Well, here the steps to get it:

- reboot the machine and wait for the boot loader
- do not allow machine boot but select the default boot entry ( normally the first one )
- then press 'e'
- jump to the kernel image (vmlinux etc) row and delete the 'rhgb quiet' directive than
- put the "rd.break enforcing=0" string at the end
- press ctrl+x and begin the boot
- when the prompt appears remount the sysroot with read/write permissions "mount -o remount,rw /sysroot"
- than chroot "chroot /sysroot"
- now change the password with 'passwd' normally
- type 'exit'
- remount sysroot with read only permission "mount -o remount,ro /sysroot"
- type 'exit' and wait for the boot ends
- login with the new password
- restore de SElinux contexes "restorecon /etc/shadow" of the password file
- set SELinux in permisive mode
- backup and clean the audit log file
- reboot
- watch for the denied issues in the audit log file, if they aren't set SElinux Enforcing and reboot.
